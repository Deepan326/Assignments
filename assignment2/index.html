          When we left newport,it was a thriving cotton town,and i hated to leave.We had built a life there,and it was so distrubing to have ta walk away from it.I have said that time and time again.I still have good friends there from those days.  One day i got a call from sam,and he said,Meet me in Kansas city,i want to busy an airplane.Boy,it took me by such surprise.I always thought he was the worlds worst driver and even my father wouldnt ever lrt sam drive him.I thought,he will kill himself the first year.so i did everything in the world to try and talk him out of that first airplane.

           Of course i needed somebody to run my new store,and I didn't have much money,so i did something i would do for the rest of my run in the retail business without any shame or embarrassment whatsoever:nose around other peoples stores searching for good talent.That's when i made my first real hire,the first manager,willard walker. Two things about sam walton distinguish him from almost everyone else i know.first,he gets up every day bound and determined to improve something.second,he is less afraid of being wrong that anyone i've ever known.And once he sees he's wrong,he just shakes it off and heads in another direction.
